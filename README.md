# Description
TODO LATER

## Goals that we plan on achieving for this app
### API Key Textbox
Allow users to enter in a key through a textbox on site which would make it easy for them to avoid having to edit the code manually
### Investment Advice
### Minigraphs
Maybe add some minigraphs for specific stocks to show investors a quick glance at them
### Cryptos and ETFs?

### Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle
Self-Explanatory
### Watchlist Functionality
Allow users to pin or save specific stocks to track them across sessions through storage on localStorage
### Company Info (This one might be a little too complex)
Show Additional info like:
* Company profile
* Revenue, market cap, dividend yield
* Recent news through a news API
### Mini Portfolio Simulator (Like Case Simulator but Stocks)
Read the Parentheses
### Price Alerts
Probably through email and warn users about when the stocks drop too low
### Download CSV
Allow users to download the CSV containing stock historical data for offline analysis
