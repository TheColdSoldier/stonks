TODO LATER

## Goals that we plan on achieving for this app
### Cryptos and ETFs?

### FIX THE TEXT IT IS UNREADABLE 
### Company Info (This one might be a little too complex)
Show Additional info like:
* Company profile
* Revenue, market cap, dividend yield
* Recent news through a news API
### Mini Portfolio Simulator (Like Case Simulator but Stocks)
Read the Parentheses
### Price Alerts
Probably through email and warn users about when the stocks drop too low
### Download CSV
Allow users to download the CSV containing stock historical data for offline analysis
